Create an App which would do following:

1. Add a Table view on the view controller
2. Add a Table view cell on the table view
3. Add an Image view on the table view cell (by increasing size of the table view cell)
4. Add a label in the table view cell
5. Create a class for Table view cell and assign the class of table view cell to the newly created file
6. Create outlets for image view and labels
7. Find images of fruits from some search engine. (better if they are not copyrighted)
8. Make the app so the fruits image and some text show up on the table view
